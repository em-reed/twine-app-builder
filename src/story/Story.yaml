  - virtu says: Something felt... wrong.
  - virtu says: “You would have to have a really weird relationship to other people to like...”
  - virtu says: “...want to own and order around something this realistic, I mean.”

  - kris says: “You don't seem well. I mean, you seem all sweaty and winded all of a sudden.”
  - kris says: “Can I take your pulse?”
  - virtu says: Kris guided me towards one of the overstuffed armchairs in the library, and I sat on the very edge of it. 
  - virtu says: He knelt down next to me, his metal fingers gently holding onto my wrist. 
  - virtu says: I exhaled, and let my current flow into him.
  - virtu says: I was curious. I wanted it. 
  - virtu says: What I felt... was not a cold appliance.

  - virtu says: “Shh!”
  - virtu says: In a panic, I reached forward to cover his mouth with my hand. 
  - virtu says: Even if he was artificial, he still had some intimate associations with that kind of contact. 
  - virtu says: We both pulled back and sat there awkwardly, in silence. 
  - virtu says: “You know... a girl has to be able to defend herself sometimes.”
  - kris says: “It's dangerous...”

  - virtu says: “Oh come on... laying on the charm. I'm here seeing your boss, you know!”
  - virtu says: Not to sound like a penthouse letter, but I couldn't believe what happened next.
  - virtu says: He eased himself onto the floor, leaning back onto his hands, and laughed.
  - virtu says: Like for a moment, he was carefree.
  - kris says: “So what were you doing just then, checking me out?”
  - virtu says: If I hadn't been blushing before, I was now. 
  - virtu says: I forgot what it felt like to be flirted back to by someone you actually found interesting, a peer. 
  - virtu says: “Maybe... a little.”
  - virtu says: He laughed at my admission again, but then looked melancholy.
  - kris says: “Sometimes I do feel... strange.”
  - kris says: “I mean, I feel like I have an inbuilt intuition for what being human is like.”
  - kris says: “Why would he make a machine just to serve people... that feels that? What's the point?”
  - virtu says: The whole situation was starting to make me nervous.
  - virtu says: The general knowledge of lifelike robotics and AI was not remotely near this level. 
  - virtu says: I would know, right? Even what guys up their own asses bragged to me about five drinks in wasn't even close.
  - virtu says: “Maybe... you're more human than you think.”

  - simon says: “I'll have to remember to tweak the hiring algorithm for mental irregularities.”

  - simon says: “To be convinced that data and machinery are equivalent to being human?”
  - simon says: “What are you thinking? (italic)I pity him?(end)”
  - virtu says: “No... I don't pity him.”
  - virtu says: “I see him for what he is... and I'm going to bring everything you've done to him down on your head.”
  - simon says: “It will be interesting to see you try, you piece of shit.”
  - virtu says: I glared into his eyes. He was amused. This was comedic to him, like an awful schoolkid crushing ants.
  - virtu says: Finally having an excuse to slap around the peasants was probably all the novelty he got in a place like this.
  - virtu says: What a fucking bastard.
  - virtu says: “I'm sick of you.”

  - virtu says: “I'm so sick of all of this...!”
  - virtu says: “Kris! Power down!”
  - kris says: “What?”
  - virtu says: “Power yourself down!”
  - virtu says: I looked at him desperately, waiting for his eyes to go dark. 
  - virtu says: Then I let go of his hand, pushing him further into the corridor.
  - virtu says: His body slumped to the floor. 
  - virtu says: Then I focused on Simon, willing the air around me to burn. 
  - virtu says: I pressed my neck against the metal cuff that held the helmet on, that he was pinning me down by.

  - virtu says: I had created a charge that not only knocked Simon off me,
  - virtu says: It also jumped to the fuse box in the maintenance corridor.
  - virtu says: For a moment, I flowed through the entire Ring.
  - virtu says: I was The Ring, in all its cruel glory, and systematic coldness. 
  - virtu says: And then, the built up electricity blew a massive hole in the side of the maintenance corridor. 
  - virtu says: The section of The Ring we were in detached at one end, and the decompression blew it off of its orbital course. 
  - virtu says: Like a river tumbling over a ledge to form a waterfall, 
  - virtu says: sections of The Ring began to tumble down and burn up in the atmosphere.
  - virtu says: The illusion of safety, luxury, security, miles up into space, in that moment, came crashing back to Earth.
  - virtu says: When I was righted and could see again, I immediately searched for anything recognizable around me. 
  - virtu says: A section of the maintenance hallways was still intact, and Kris' body was cradled inside. 
  - virtu says: Thank goodness I had filled the suit's propulsion power, just to be safe. 
  - virtu says: I jetted over to him.
  - virtu says: In space, his body was unbelievably light. 
  - virtu says: I thought to myself, I might not have the chance to do something this gallant ever again...
  - virtu says: I lifted and carried his body easily. Even a bridal carry was effortless.
  - virtu says: Despite the void of space outside, I half-raised my visor, for just a second.
  - virtu says: To press my lips to his, to pass my current into him. 
  - virtu says: That was how I turned him back on.

  - virtu says: Floating hand-in-hand over clouds of debris, we eventually found an escape pod that had been deployed in a rush, improperly. 
  - virtu says: The door was ajar, and there was a body inside. 
  - virtu says: “God help me.”
  - virtu says: Kris watched as I reflexively crossed myself, then pulled the stiff corpse out of the escape pod. 
  - virtu says: I pulled him into the escape pod with me, 
  - virtu says: and then made sure the capsule had properly sealed and pressurized before removing my helmet. 
  - virtu says: We navigated over The Ring, which was slowly unwinding, looking for any place to make a pit stop.
  - virtu says: There was a trading port where some other escape pods that had evacuated seemed to be gathering. 
  - virtu says: Everyone in the port stood around tensely, watching the news on the big screens hung along the walls.
  - virtu says: Kris and I found a place to sit in a large cafeteria.
  - virtu says: No one ate, leaving their half-finished meals in front of them...
  - virtu says: as they watched humanity's largest financial project, the crown jewel of techno-capital, destroy itself.
  - reporter says: “We have information coming in that the billionaire tech entrepreneur Simon Lanstrom, has been rescued from the rubble”
  - reporter says: “While he was only able to give a brief testimony before being put into a medically-induced coma for treatment,” 
  - reporter says: “...this testimony has led to this disaster, already known as The Rupture, to be investigated as a terrorist act.” 
  - reporter says: “All residents of The Ring are being biometrically tracked and accounted for in light of their potential involvement.”  
  - virtu says: “Shit!”
  - virtu says: I stood abruptly, and headed to where I had parked the escape pod. 
  - virtu says: I folded up my suit that was registered to The Ring, and gave the pod a firm shove with my foot, 
  - virtu says: sending it drifting out into space and hopefully away from the port. 
  - virtu says: We had to figure out something. 
  - virtu says: Fortunately, a port was a good place to need those kind of services.  
  - virtu says: Deep within the loading bays, I found a garbage freighter...
  - virtu says: ...captained by a man who looked like he hadn't watched the news in decades. 
  - virtu says: He had a stolid indifference to the world. 
  - virtu says: He seemed to operate on a much slower time scale, maybe one where I was still in elementary school, eternally. 
  - virtu says: I begged him to let us aboard. We needed to get away.
  - captain says: “Away? Well, we're going all the way out to Jupiter.”
  - virtu says: “Perfect. We'll work. We'll make up our passage for sure.”
  - captain says: “Not much to do. But the crew will appreciate not having to wash the dishes, I suppose.”  
  - virtu says: I laughed in glorious relief. 
  - virtu says: “Deal! Absolutely a deal.”
  - virtu says: After weeks of serving as a background extra for the wealthy,
  - virtu says: without even the actor's union protections such a description implied...
  - virtu says: something as normal as washing dishes was a dream job.
  - virtu says: It was a trash freighter. All it did was take trash away. 
  - virtu says: There was no automated security to ping the authorities that this was where we were.
  - virtu says: Kris registering a clearly non-human weight on the cargo scale hardly even merited a raised eyebrow from the crew.
  - virtu says: As the ship pulled out of port, I thought about how, eventually, we'd make it beyond the Earth enforcement line.
  - virtu says: It was safe, or, at least, the best place to wait and figure out our next move. 
  - virtu says: But, standing next to me, Kris frowned. He didn't seem so sure.

  - supervisor says: “There was an electronic registration ping, at a cargo outpost near the asteroid belt.” 
  - supervisor says: “We got the call this morning.”
  - agata says: “Was it her?”
  - supervisor says: “No... it was a type of commercial component developed by Langstrom's company...”

  - supervisor says: “A garbage ship. It didn't match to any of the crew's property, either. Or current market commercial goods.”

  - supervisor says: “Yes, the working assumption is that she must have stowed away on that ship somehow.”
  - supervisor says: “A clever move... if all she wanted was to get away.”

  - supervisor says: “Regardless of how we slice it, even if we got in the fastest lightship available, right now...”
  - supervisor says: “It's still only a 50/50 shot of meeting them at the enforcement line.”
  - supervisor says: “And a lightship won't cut it if we're trying to make an arrest and capture anyway.”
  - supervisor says: “So she's pretty much guaranteed to be out of our jurisdiction.”

  - supervisor says: “What I'm saying is, you gotta live life a bit while you're still young.”
  - supervisor says: “Well, younger than me!”

  - virtu says: including tolerance of strange circumstances, was a matter of fact. 
  - virtu says: Even though Kris didn't need to eat anything, he still came along to meals.
  - virtu says: Participating in the conversations seemed to relax him, and no one asked questions about his robotic hands.

  - virtu says: “Are you anxious about going out to Jupiter, for some reason?”

  - virtu says: “Come on, I could tell something was on your mind back when we boarded.”

  - kris says: “Well, his moon mining operation is out there, isn't it?”
  - kris says: “Who knows... how many copies of me... or worse...”
  - kris says: “Versions of what I'd become under different situations...”
  - kris says: “A “tweaked” version of myself...”
  - kris says: “I'm probably just one edit of a totally different original.
  - kris says: “It makes me sick to think about. It's horrible.”
  - kris says: “To confront that I'm just--”
  - virtu says: “No. If you're afraid because you're embarrassed or think I'll consider you less human...”
  - virtu says: “Don't be. I wouldn't fall so easily for someone unless they had a strong sense of self.”
  - virtu says: I knew that if he could blush, he would have been blushing.
  - kris says: “You don't have to... you're just saying that.”
  - virtu says: “I'm not.”
  - virtu says: “What Simon did you you is horrible... What he's done to everyone is.”
  - virtu says: “But that doesn't make you less human to me.”
  - virtu says: “I know you... Whatever's out there won't change that.”
  - kris says: “...Thanks.”
  - virtu says: “Really, it doesn't bother me.”
  - virtu says: “To be honest, sometimes I think...”
  - virtu says: “trying to be human the right way has never been something I could do anyways.” 
  - virtu says: “So no wonder we get along so well...” 
  - virtu says: He smiled, pressing the tips of his fingers into mine.
  - virtu says: “What do you think, if I wanted to join you, do you think you could figure out how to image my brain?”
  - virtu says: He frowned slightly at this. I couldn't tell if he disliked the idea or was just thinking.
  - virtu says: “If it came down to it, like in an emergency, could you like... download me?”
  - virtu says: “Let me into you... huh?”
  - virtu says: He was hesitant, but still answered me.
  - kris says: “When I feel the pulses from you, I understand how it might work.”
  - kris says: “If we can attach some sort of high speed data transmitter to a point where your electric current is focused,” 
  - kris says: “I could probably request and receive the data that way.”
  - virtu says: “Right! And the upside is then, we'd really be together.”
  - kris says: “...We're together now.”
  - virtu says: “I know, I guess I was just trying to put a positive spin on it.”

  - simon says: “something that could be downloaded and run wherever you can place the hardware,”
  - simon says: “hardware that would have a human mind, and be able to maintain, adapt and repair itself and others,”
  - simon says: “Wouldn't all those problems be solved?
  - simon says: “And, you know, a few years of funding the largest computational research lab plus satellite university programs...”
  - simon says: “Well, you've met the results. So has Virtu.”
  - agata says: “...If you were successful, why is there only one android? Wouldn't you want to try a variety of people?”
  - simon says: “Well it's... kind of an off-label feature.” 
  - simon says: “The imaging device was made for partial scanning and therapeutic purposes.” 
  - simon says: “So I had to bide my time for a moment to test what it could really do.”
  - simon says: “And when you have a situation where someone is basically going to die anyways...”
  - simon says: “A soft-hearted humanist researcher who thinks technology can solve all of our problems will be easy to convince.”
  - simon says: “There was an earthquake near one of the research outpost universities, and a student was severely injured.”
  - simon says: “It was his own professor who called me! Sobbing.”
  - simon says: “I planted the idea in her mind, and then told her to copy the file to me,”
  - simon says: “with the implication I'd pass it on to the most advanced robotics and prosthetics labs, of course.”
  - agata says: “And you made him your fucking butler!?”
  - simon says: “I mean, I made him more than that.”
  - simon says: “But yes, that one's good to keep around in that capacity, with a little editing.”
  - agata says: “...Editing?”
  - simon says: “The therapeutic imaging device allows doctors to analyze the process of connections forming in the brain over time.”
  - simon says: “It's excellent for early intervention to locate trauma,”
  - simon says: “but it also gives you all the data you need to completely reform a certain sense of self.”
  - simon says: “And when the file is wholly digital, of course you can just delete a few lines, reverse the steps...”
  - agata says: My heart was pounding in my chest. I felt ill. 
  - agata says: “So in essence, you're making human brains into a copyable file and lobotomizing them?”
  - simon says: “That is... how a luddite who can only relate to things in terms of their limited embodied experience would see it, yes.”
  - agata says: ...
  - simon says: “But, well, you have one of those files now.” 
  - simon says: “Maybe you could, theoretically, come to understand.”
  - agata says: “So... you're just letting me go?”
  - simon says: “What were you expecting me to do?”
  - agata says: “Hang on...”
  - agata says: “Your armed guards are everywhere, surrounding this complex.” 
  - agata says: “If you really cared about keeping the lid on this,” 
  - agata says: “you could just quietly kill me now.”
  - agata says: An unemployed ex-cop would disappear as easily as a corpse into a snowbank.
  - simon says: “Oh come on, I'm not (italic)evil(end).”
  - simon says: “It's just... Okay, if you want to try to make me look like the bad guy here...”
  - simon says: “Where would you go? Who would you talk to?”
  - simon says: “This sounds totally insane, doesn't it?”
  - simon says: “You don't even (italic)want(end) to talk, do you?”
  - agata says: ...
  - agata says: He was right. Somehow he had sensed my shame about the whole thing.
  - agata says: The guilt I felt about what I did to her, my irrational fixation. 
  - agata says: I only wanted to know for myself. 
  - agata says: Threatening to turn it into some sort of scandal was just hot air. 
  - simon says: “I have a very systematic mind.” 
  - simon says: “I went through all the possibilities of your actions on finding this out, and determined your threat to me...”
  - simon says: “is nil.”
  - simon says: “You wouldn't even try to do anything funny.”
  - simon says: “And, well, you have first hand experience with the state's own surveillance apparatus, right?”
  - simon says: “You can only imagine what the private sector is capable of.”

      - agata says: It was a nice dream, but Virtu Cavna is gone. 
      - agata says: I felt death in the air when I had talked to Simon Lanstrom in his glamorous consumption ward.
      - agata says: Trying to bring her back, through messing with some sort of digital file...
      - agata says: To me it was like playing with a corpse. 
      - agata says: I couldn't.
      - agata says: I had to think about what I did. Why I felt so compelled. Cope with the guilt. 
      - agata says: Accept that I will never have a chance to know her. 
      - agata says: Accept that maybe another person's mind is never fully knowable in the first place. 
      - agata says: But the thing is...
      - agata says: Once something exists as a digital file, it's impossible to tell how many are out there,
      - agata says: Circulating, copying, living out an entirely different life...
      - agata says: I can only hope, I guess, that anyone who comes across that file will make the same choice.
      - agata says: ...
      - agata says: Maybe though, if I am honest with myself...
      - agata says: Part of me still hopes at least one person won't.

      - agata says: and think about what to do.
      - agata says: I know that if I run the file in some sort of interface that allows communication, 
      - agata says: Virtu's mind may be hypothetically able to communicate with me.
      - agata says: Maybe that scares me a bit...
      - agata says: Of course it does! It's scary.
      - agata says: I don't want to know what she thinks of me, in the moment she died, or rather, let her body die.
      - agata says: Maybe, as a gesture, to make it up to her, I should have some sort of improvised robotic body ready.
      - agata says: Would she like that? Or would it seem presumptuous? 
      - agata says: God...
      - agata says: It really is so hard just to apologize.

      - agata says: I instead sit there, the whole time, watching the bar slowly fill. 
      - agata says: Then...
      - agata says: She's there. In my downloads folder. What a cruddy place to come into existence. 
      - agata says: I drag her into her own folder on the desktop. Is that better?
      - agata says: ...
      - agata says: I know if I run the file, I may as well be waking up her mind.
      - agata says: I think about what state her mind was in.
      - agata says: Dying alone, in space. 
      - agata says: Raging at me, or maybe...
      - agata says: Confused... afraid.
      - agata says: I opened the file in a code editor, and found the dated lines of neural folds and pathways.
      - agata says: Deleting a little of this was ultimately kind to her, right?
      - agata says: Surely she'd gone through a lot of pain,
      - agata says: As a fugitive, or even before that.
      - agata says: As a normal woman driven to... to what?
      - agata says: I peered at the lines of code.
      - agata says: Ultimately, the way I could truly find out what kind of person she was...
      - agata says: I held down the shift and up keys, highlighting line after line.
      - agata says: What if I took her back, to before she'd even gone to The Ring?
      - agata says: I hit the delete key.
