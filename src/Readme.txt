FLESH/CIRCUIT
Made for the Believeinthe.net 1 jam, May 2021

Author's Note: This is a story that has been in my brain for a long time. The format I always imagined it in was some sort of huge, hyper-complex Hideo Kojima type game, and therefore I just kept an increasingly sprawling plot building and building via disjointed scenes and concepts in my head, rather than doing anything about it. 

I remember how much I loved writing as a kid and feel like I'm only just getting back on my feet doing it now. Part of what inspires me though is a work like the Kill The Past series. It's an amazing story, and I feel like I've gotten a lot of inspiration from writing fanfic and participating in discussions about the characters and scenarios. More importantly, though, seeing the film window system in The Silver Case and The 25th Ward as well as Suda51's comments on it as a way to tell a complex, in-depth story with limited resources also really inspired me, as someone who's always loved visual novels but could never draw to my satisfaction.

For the jam, I decided to work this story down to the core and see if I could exorcize it, and then use very limited CGs and sound and animation effects to get the story across. Maybe it's not as grandiose or elaborate as I imagined, but it also gains something from being presented in this raw sort of way. Thank you for playing it!
